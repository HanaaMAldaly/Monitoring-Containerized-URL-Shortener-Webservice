# Monitoring-Containerized-URL-Shortener-Webservice
This project involves creating a webservice that shortens URLs, stores the  mapping, and handles redirects. You will then instrument this service to expose custom  performance metrics. Finally, you will use Prometheus to collect these metrics and Grafana to  build a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing the service's health and usage patterns.
